```c
// You can make a new nob-h project using one of these commands:
// npx create-nobuild@latest
// yarn create nobuild
// pnpm create nobuild@latest

// This would be the nob.c config file.

// This will only work for Linux because it uses Wayland. And that is Linux only.

#define NOB_IMPLEMENTATION

// The nob.h library has to be in the same folder as nob.c (this file).
#include "nob.h"

#define BUILD_FOLDER "build/"
#define SRC_FOLDER   "src/"
#define FLAGS        "-lwayland-client"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  // This self-rebuild mechanism checks if nob.c was modified
  // If youâ€™ve updated the build script, remove the existing binary to force a rebuild
  NOB_GO_REBUILD_URSELF(argc, argv);

  Nob_Cmd cmd = {0};
